# venus-web

If it ever happens to be finished, this project is going to be an
interactive graph-based programming enviroment backed by nushell.

## building and running

You can run the development build by cloning the repo and executing `npm run dev`.

However, it is likely the web application won't work, because it requries the
`.wasm` nushell binary and its JS bindings.

This can be accomplished by following the build instructions of **TODO: venus-nushell here**
and moving the generated package to `src/nu`.
